			<p>Nice to meet you !! My Name is Aliya Vatelot. I was born and raised in France. I moved to Dubai when I was 9 years old to study at an international school. That's when I knew I wanted to lead an international life. Also, as i've visited many places around the world throughout my vacations, Sri Lanka being one of my favourite places, I have become curious and open-minded. I'm currently living in Cergy, where I'm studying a degree in Business Administration at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School</p>

			<h2>MY LIFE AS AN ESSEC STUDENT</h2>
			<p> I don't have any association but I enjoy helping my friends with theirs. We like to go to Paris which is only 30 minutes away in RER A. We like to party during the week-end (and the week 😉). I really enjoy being an ESSEC student as there are a lot of international students here. I've met people from countries all over the world. I appreciate learning about different cultures and traditions. <p/>

			<p> I also enjoy learning new things as marketing, or economics. I believe I've made a great choice by choosing to study business in ESSEC. Every teacher is wholesome and quite patient (except for some...). We have a lot of work these days, therefore we can't go out as we used to when we arrived to Cergy. It's not really a problem to me, I realize we have to work and can't always party. </p>

			<h2>FASHION</h2>
			<p> I've been into fashion for as long as I can remember. I truly enjoy good outfits, things that are visually aesthetic. Living next to Paris has reinforced this passion for fashion, I can go easily tothrift shops. There is the fashion week twice a year. And isn't Paris the city of fashion ? There are all the great designers as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton. </p>

			<p>Also, I feel like fashion helps to communicate with people from everywhere. It's like an unique language that truly evrybody understands.</p>

			<p>Talking about fashion, I want to warn you about fast fashion and its dangers. Fast fashion is a relatively new phenomenon in the industry that causes extensive damage to the planet, exploits workers, and harms animals. Here's why it is best to thrift and to boycott big brands. </p>

			<h2>MY SPORT LIFE</h2>
			<p align=”justify”>I'm a very active and enthusiastic girl, so sports are a part of my daily life. I have done many sports throughout my whole life. These include horse riding, surfing, dance, judo, skiing and swimming. There's not a single sport so far, out of these, that I haven't enjoyed.</p>


			<p align=”justify”> Overall, without sports, I wouldn't have become who I currently am; I feel they're part of my personality.</p>

			<h2>INTERNSHIP</h2>
			<p align=”justify”> I am currently looking for a 3 months internship to validate my first year of studies. I need to achieve this internship in communication, marketing or finance. It's quite hard to find but if you happen to be passing by my website, take a look at my LinkedIn down there. </p>
